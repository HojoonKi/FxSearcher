A single violin note held in a frozen cave, creating a shimmering, icy sound trail.

A hollow flute melody played by a cheap plastic toy with simple, airy notes.

A fragmented trumpet call echoing down a spaceship corridor as if from a distant chamber.

An acoustic guitar strummed inside a tin can, creating a hollow, metallic jangle.

A crumbling organ chord played on a cracked vinyl record that skips and pops.
